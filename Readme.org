* The Sex language
Sex is a S-expressions language, which transpiles to C.

* Compilation and usage
Sex is written in Chicken Scheme, so first you'll need to get yourself
a Chicken.

** Compilation
~make~

** Usage
You'll also need a C compiler, so pick any.
#+begin_src
cat hello-world.sex | sexc > hello_world.c
cc hello_world.c -o hello_world
#+end_src

* Features
** Full C interoperability
Just ~(include "Your/Favourite/Library.h")~ and use it as you would
have is C.

For hardcore fans of traditional Lisp naming convention,
Sex offers automatic unkebabification of all symbols, i.e. no more
ugly ~GL_ARRAY_BUFFER~s in your code, they may be writted in their
proper form: ~GL-ARRAY-BUFFER~.

** Use an established environment for development
As Sex is S-expressions, you always have Emacs with paredit as your
best option.

** COMING SOON: Polymorhpism
